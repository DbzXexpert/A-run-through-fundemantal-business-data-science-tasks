1. **Business Metrics** - Monthly KPIs: Revenue, Growth Rate, Active Orders, Average Revenue per Order
2. **Consumer Metrics** - Cohort analysis, Retention rate, Churn rate, Cohort-based retention rate
3. **Customer Journey** - From acquisition to activation, engagement and retention
4. **Customer Growth** - Attribution, Channel optimisation (First-touch, Last-touch, Markov Chain) 
5. **Customer Segmentation** - Clustering and Segmentation (using RFM Recency, Frequency and Monetary Value)
